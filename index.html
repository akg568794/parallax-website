                Adventure Time!</h2>

                    An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome. Adventures may be
                    activities with some potential for physical danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting, or participating in extreme 
                    sports. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial, or psychological risk, such as a
                    business venture, or other major life undertakings.<br> <br>
                    Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure
                    tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers â€“ the British adventurer
                    Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on
                    expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.

                    cycling, use of a bicycle for sport, recreation, or transportation. The sport of cycling consists of professional and amateur races, which are held mostly in continental Europe, the United States, and Asia. The recreational use of the bicycle is widespread in Europe and the United States. Use of the bicycle as a mode of transportation is particularly important in non-Western nations and in flatter countries, some of which, like the Netherlands, have a widespread system of bicycle paths.<br> <br>
                    Cycling as a sport officially began on May 31, 1868, with a 1,200-metre (1,312-yard) race between the fountains and the entrance of Saint-Cloud Park (near Paris). The winner was James Moore, an 18-year-old expatriate Englishman from Paris. On November 7, 1869, the first city-to-city race was held between Paris and Rouen; again Moore was the winner, having covered the 135 km (84 miles) in 10 hours 25 minutes, including time spent walking his bicycle up the steeper hills.

                    Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.<br> <br>

                <p class="text">
                    Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.<br> <br>
                    The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
